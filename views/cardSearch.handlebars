<!--//this will handle the displaying of card data when a search is done for a card-->

<!--//user will search for a pokemon card-->

<!--//can search by pokemon name (alphanumeric string)-->

<!--//MissingNo (the thing from pokemon) will be displayed when no results are returned form the user search-->

<!--//all cards related to the search will be displayed-->

<!--//potential implementation of infinite scrolling (real iffy on this one)-->
