# TCG-Deck-Builder

This is a deck building application for the Pokemon trading card game. Users have the ability to search for cards and then add them to decks. Users can then view fully built decks and delete them if they choose. i designed each page layout and built the architecture of each page in handlebars. Some key features that I believe really help the user navigate the site are the helper text that comes up when the user adds a card to the deck and also the semantic delete button that is nested in the upper right hand corner of cards on the deck list display page.


### **Users builds decks using pokemon data from the official Pokemon TCG website.**
